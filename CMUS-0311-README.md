# 1. Introduction
For today’s session, we will use R for geospatial data science, automating GIS workflows.  
Make sure you have the [Simple Features library](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) installed.  
To get started with spatial data in R, see this great [intro tutorial](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2021/06/using-geospatial-data-in-r/)  
If you wish to dive deeper into spatial data science in R, here are two excellent (free) references:  
- [R-spatial](https://r-spatial.org/book/)
- [Geocomputation with R](https://r.geocompx.org/intro)

# 2. Data
Switzerland has excellent open data in general, and geodata is no exception. See for example:  
[Swiss administrative boundaries](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/en/landscape-model-swissboundaries3d#swissBOUNDARIES3D---Download)  
Make sure to download the Shapefile (.shp) format  
Also download a subset of the Panel Lémanique GPS tracking dataset (scan QR code)  
More info on this dataset (in french) [here](https://assets.super.so/15749c3c-d748-4e49-bff7-6fc9ec745dc4/files/087cfa6f-fdb6-475b-aa92-6bf78a3c58e7/240820_rapport_GPS_panel_lemanique.pdf)

#3. IMPORTANT!!! COORDINATE REFERENCE SYSTEMS (CRS)
Before we do anything geospatial, we have to understand [Coordinate Reference Systems](https://earthdatascience.org/courses/earth-analytics/spatial-data-r/intro-to-coordinate-reference-systems/)

#4. You should be good to go with the CMUS-0311-Exercise - have fun!
