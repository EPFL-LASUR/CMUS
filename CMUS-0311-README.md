# 1. Introduction
For todayâ€™s session, we will use R for geospatial data science, automating GIS workflows.  
Make sure you have the [Simple Features library](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) installed.  
To get started with spatial data in R, see this great [intro tutorial](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2021/06/using-geospatial-data-in-r/)  
If you wish to dive deeper into spatial data science in R, here are two excellent (free) references:  
- [R-spatial](https://r-spatial.org/book/)
- [Geocomputation with R](https://r.geocompx.org/intro)

# 2. Data
Switzerland has excellent open data in general, and geodata is no exception. See for example:  
[Swiss administrative boundaries](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/en/landscape-model-swissboundaries3d#swissBOUNDARIES3D---Download)  
Make sure to download the .shp format
