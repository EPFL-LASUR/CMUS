# 5. Get started with Git and Github - you won't regret it
Git is the world's most common (and user-friendly) version control system.  
It enables people to collaborate on code seamlessly, avoiding conflicts.  
Although not absolutely required for this course, it is highly recommended.  
Spending a 30 minutes learning Git workflows now will save you hours down the line!
GitHub is an cloud-based Git repository platform: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/about-github-and-git
