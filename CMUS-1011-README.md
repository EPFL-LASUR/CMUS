# 1. Introduction  
For today’s session, we will use R to explore some basic network science techniques.  
Make sure you have the [igraph](https://r.igraph.org), [ggraph](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com) and [tidygraph](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com) libraries installed.  
To get started with network science in R, see this great [intro tutorial](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2021/06/using-geospatial-data-in-r/)  
If you wish to dive deeper into network science in R, here are two good (free) references:  
- [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/NetworkAnalysis.html)  
- [LADAL](https://slcladal.github.io/net.html)  

# 2. Data
For this practice session, you are free to download network data of your choice from [SNAP](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/).  
For example, i chose to download a [Facebook social network](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/ego-Facebook.html) dataset.
