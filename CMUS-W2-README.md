# 1. Download the necessary packages
Please run the first piece of code in R and make sure all the libraries are correctly installed.  

# 2. Create a token for OPAL
https://panel-lemanique-data.epfl.ch/
Your username is your first name (lowercase, no accent). The password will be provided during the class.
Go to "My Profile" and then create a new R token. Name it, choose "Read Only" and tick both import and export boxes.
Then save your token somewhere - you will only see it once!
Once done, please provide your token in the R script.  

# 3. Load the data
Create an OPAL environment in R and load both databases (wave 1 and wave 2). Make sure to disconnect from OPAL afterwards.

# 4. Complementary data
Download the complementary data from moodle (under Week 2) and save it in the working directory you provided to RStudio.  

# 5. Data handling
Before diving in the results, the data needs to be twisted quiet a bit. Please complete the following tasks in order for the code to run :
1) Assignment 1 : Join the complementary data to the "palem" object. Consider inspiration from Lines 74-76.
2) Assignment 2 : Create a new categorical variable for the number of coffees individuals had in the past week. Consider inspiration from above and below lines.

# 6. Multiple Correspodnance Analysis
After the demonstration of the MCA and the description of dimensions 1 and 3, please fill the following gaps in the code :
1) Assignment 3 : Summarize what are the main variables contributing to dimension 2 (scope). Consider inspiration from Lines 466-468.
2) Assignment 4 : Reproduce the same two-dimensional graph but with dimensions 1 and 2, then characterize and name the latter. Start by copy-pasting the example demonstrated for dimensions 1 and 3.

# 7. Contribute!
The rest of the R session will be collaborative.
